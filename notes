< nvplib.py > <-- do dis first
- check default transport zone
- check tenant
    > Network functions
- get network (switch)
- create lswitch 
- update network (switch)
- get all networks (switches for tenant)
    uses tag=<tenantid>&tag_scope=os_tid
- query networks (switch)
    takes tenant_id but does not pass it as it has
    a tags (list) argument that might include it
- delete network (switch)
- delete networks (switch)
- create network (object)
    creates a dictionary description of an lswitch
    with the tenant id, internal use probably
    > Port functions
- get port stats
    network id is switch id; attempts to find the
    switch first then attempts to get the stats on
    the port
- check port state
    internal function to check if a port state is of
    VVL
- query ports (lport of switch)
    allows filtering by relations and attachment uuid
- delete port
    does not look for the network first
- delete all ports (lports of switch)
    does no error checking, could and should use the
    previous function, delete port
- get port (lport of switch)
    supports relations
- plug interface (vif and port)
- unplug interface (vif and port)
- update port
    performs a little bit of logic based on state
- create port (port on lswitch)
    sets admin_status_enabled based on the initial
    state of the port [UP|DOWN], should use a 
    constant instead of magic string
- get port status (port on lswitch)
    checks the status and returns the magic strings
    that everything else uses [UP|DOWN]

< QuantumPlugin.py >
- uses config file nvp.ini
- and messes with some paths
- init config (probably just copy)
    will try to load the configuration file from all
    the silly paths it made earlier; will raise if
    there isn't a config file
- find config (probably just copy)
    will try to look for the config file from all
    the silly paths
- parse config (probably just copy)
    parses a config file
    > NVPCluster class (omg a class)
- add controller
    does what it says
- bunches of properties
    these only return the first controller's info, so
    I don't know what good this is as a multi-
    controller system
    > NvpPlugin class
- essentially a wrapper over nvplib.py
- all functionality adds a little bit of logic though
